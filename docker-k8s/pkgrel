## only necessary, e.g. if (relevant) vulnerabilities in image packages have been detected.
## github action "tails" the last line of this file to extract the relevant release and tags.
## the 'r0'-suffix is the initial release version, so an updated release suffix should start with 'r1', following 'r2', 'r3', etc.
1.10.0-r1
